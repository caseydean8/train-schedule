# train-schedule

This site utilizes a firebase database and moment.js to update a train schedule.
The user enters a train name, destination, first train time, and route frequency which is then submitted to a database.
The site then uses jquery to pull data back from the database and calculate when the next train will arrive and how many minutes are remaining until the next arrival.
