# TrainScend

This site utilizes a firebase database and moment.js to update a train schedule.

The user enters a train name, destination, first train time, and route frequency which is then submitted to a database.

The site then uses jquery to pull data back from the database and moment.js to calculate when the next train will arrive and how many minutes are remaining until the next arrival.
